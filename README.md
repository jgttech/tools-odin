# Tools (Odin Edition)

My personal utilities and tools, but written in Odin.

## Prerequisites

- [odin](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install)
- [zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
- [jq](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/jq/)

## Development

> This is just so I can run the CLI without doing an optimized build.

```bash
./run <args>
```

## Build

> Builds the optimized binary

```bash
./build
```
